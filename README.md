This is an experimental repo for implementing the Fmask4.0 algorithm, as described by

Qiu, S., Zhu, Z., & He, B. (2019). Fmask 4.0: Improved cloud and cloud shadow 
detection in Landsats 4-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Remote Sensing of Environment, 231, 111205.

The changes are in a test branch called fmask4improvements, and are not yet complete or stable. 
Use with caution. 

For a stable implementation of the earlier Fmask algorithm(s) (Zhu et al, 2012; Zhu et al, 2015),
